you would have to install socket.io in the folder using the command
npm install socket.io 
Local host = 8080 
To run on client: http://localhost:8080/client.html
Part 1 works perfectly, I made multiple divs and rendered them in a hardcoded fashion. I used onClick feature to react to clicks and sent the updated state back to server.
Part 2: Made a result function which finds out the winner and emits it.
Part 3: Did not attempt.
Part 4: Used a list of sockets to render multiple games and worked fine on my machine.
